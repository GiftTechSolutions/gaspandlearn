        <div class="dibo">
          <p>Most people know of zombies mostly from fictional movies and stories, and everybody believes that they are just imaginary creations and are not real. What if we are all wrong?!</p>
<p>Zombie word is an haitian name (nzambi) used to describe a  corpse reanimaeted by voodo priests known as bokors. The zombies are roumered to be used for free labour  </p>
<p>There are severall cases of zombification reported in haiti am going to look at some and let you be the judge of the existence of zombies </p>
<p>It is estimated that 70-80% of haitians practice voodou.In vodou all people die in two ways naturally(sickness/god's will) and unnaturally (murdered before there time)</p>
<p>those who die unnaturaly linger in the graves un able to join the ancestors until the god's approve</p>
<p>It is at this particular situation that  powerful sorcerers are able to snatch the souls of the dead man and trap it in a bottle and later use it to control the undead but un-living body</p>
<p>Zombies can also be made by this bokors by casting spells on living people and through use of toxins from puffer fish and many other components</p>
<p>one man a former bokor who found christ states that they coud cast spells on a victim who coud die withtin the next few days and perfom some extra rituals to force the victim's early burial. The corpse will start to swell and stink but will immediately stop when placed inside a coffin so this could force the family members of the deceased to bury the victim as soon as possible </p>
<p>The bokors would later come late in the night and retrive the body of the zombie to go and use for their own malcious activities</p>
<p>i even found videos online of interviews of haitian zombies </p>
<p>There is a man who goes by the name wilfred who died and was buried. And after 18 months he appeared in his village with scars on his wrists showing that he was in chains where he had been kept for the last 18months </p>
<p>What shocked the villagers the most was that they saw him dead and buried. He said he was forced to work on plantations for free till the day he escaped, but his parents and friends say he is not the same wilfred they used to know he seems retarted and has very aggresive tendecies </p>
