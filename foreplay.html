        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Fore-play</h2>

        <div>
          <p>This is any sexual activity that happens before intercourse to spice up things</p>
          <p>Fore play is very important especially with women, women take more time to be fully aroused</p>
          <p>It will be a long article but am not leaveing anything out not today</p>
          <img src="fo.jpg" width="100%">
          <p>First remember skin contact is very important. Start with kisses, you can tease her when kissing. Lean in as if to kiss her  and back away not too fast or too far back though, this will driver her crazy and long for  that kiss, she might grab you and go for it herself, good  for you if she does this it will make her think she really wants it</p>
          <p>As the kisses get dipper and more passionate you can hold her waist and pull her close to you, you can also grab her ass  suductively<img src="spread.jpg" width="100%">, the but is very sensitive and women love it when you give attetion to her butt</p>
          <p>You can also hold up one of her thighs <img src="kll.jpg" width="100%">, or take her by both <img src=""> and pin her to a wall if you can, dont forget her neck too, their are many nerve endings around the neck and ears, edge the tip of your of your tongue in her ear and breathe into them at this point she should be really turned on, you will start to notice her breathing increase, maybe get weak and hold on to you, you should be undressing her in the process</p>
          <p>Use your hands be creative, at this  point  you can massage her breasts, start gently and add the pressure slowly
          tease her nipple pinch them and the reaction she will give you... no spoiler alerts.You can also lick them and suck on them and drive her totally crazy</p>
          <p>Pay attention to the rest of her body too not just her ass boobs, kiss her belly and roll your tongue up her body between her breasts and to the neck, as you do this slide your fingers in a ticklish manner up her innner thigh slowly heading for the pussy, if she is not breatheing crazy and loosing her mind, by now dude i dont know what you doing.</p>
          <p>Tap her pussy gently but enough to give sensations slide your arm in her panties and spread her pussy lips wide as if you want to finger her then stop</p>
          <p>The idea is to tease her and make her wait for the  touch, dont give it to her immediately make her wait for it</p>
          <p>Take your hand away and pull her panties upwards such that it applies pressure on her pussy <img src="pn.jpg" width="100%">, if it can get between her pussy lips the better, keep tugging upwards as you kiss her do this for a few seconds and stop</p>
          <p>Frustrate her a little and make her wait for it</p>
          <P>Turn her on her back.This is my favourite part.Kiss her back and blow air on her back and most likely she will quiver slightly from the tickle and exitement, use the rigged edges of a condom wrap and slide it gently up and down her back in a ticklish manner, 
          </P>
          <p>You can start massageing her back, this will totally make her relax and horny, you will see her moan gently grub on the sheets or something, she might close her eyes too, use diffrent techniques as shoen in the photos below</p>
          <img src="mog.jpg" width="100%">
          <img src="mo.jpg" width="100%">
          <img src="m.jpg" width="100%">
          <p>Use your elbows to apply extra pressure on erector spinae muscles<img src="bcc.jpg" width="100%">both on the upper and lower back (extra tip get her to do dead-lifts a day before giveing her the back massage i promise 100% she will moan and totally go crazy and get horny asf, because her muscle will be soar and crave for a massage, she will feel a mix of soar sweet sensation trust me her soul will leave her body), pay attetion to how she responds  to your touch if she jerks upwards and cant seem to be able close her mouth you are on point, dont forget to tease her, give her a taste and then take it away, make her demand for more</p>
          <p>The aim is to make her hungry for more, she will be arching her back ready for penetration now, but we are not done yet</p>
          <p>Lube your fingers and start with the clitoris rub it gently and add the pressure gradually, most people avoid the clitoris trust me you dont want to ignore this <img src="clli.jpg" width="100%">, you can uncover it from the hood and flicker it if she doesnt gasp i dont know what on earth you doing</p>
          <p>Massage the outer pussy lips and add pressure as you progress, edge the inner lips too and slowly put one finger in her about 2-3inches (upper part)<img src="g-spote.jpg" width="100%"> in look for a rough surface that feels like the top of your mouth(G-spot) and massage it in a come here motion, Do this gently as you add pressure gradually kiss her neck and lips in the process</p>
          <p>Use the upper parts of your palms to rub the clit as you keep fingering the g-spot if she cannot compleate sentences and words good job</p>
          <p>She might orgasm if you keep doing this<img src="org.jpg" width="100%"> its ok to ask her to direct you, to her sensitive spots</p>
          <p>Slide your fingers deeper and look for a spot that feels like a balloon and should be smooth(a-spot) if you get it she will totally loose her mind and you will notice her arching her back in pleasure</p>
          <p>She might try to persuade you to penetrate her by now but you know better, make wait and anticipate for a while</p>
          <P>When you are finally ready to go in, tease her in the process, insert the tip and push it up, outwards though and rub the clit</P>
          <p>Remember to take your time and be patient</p>
          <p>If you got her to jog the day before, her groin will be soar and she enjoy the stretching  when to open her legs wide apart</p>
